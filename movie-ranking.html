<h3>Warrior<br />
    2011</h3>
<p>A stellar film with a great story, acting, and action. The fight sequences are among the most realistic. 
    The relationships between the three leads drive the plot forward. A man's movie.</p>

<h3>Ford V Ferrari<br />
    2019</h3>
<p>The writing in this film is incredibly natural. No line or scene feels forced. 
    The racing cinematography is thrilling and the score goes right along with it.</p>

<h3>9<br />
    2009</h3>
<p>The premise of the film is quite thought-provoking, and art style is very macabre and grim, which is cool.
    It's a very unique film.</p>
